# Hi, I'm Vaz üëã
## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Vaz Singh. I work as a  Desktop Support Analyst at UCA, a specialist art and design university in the south of England. 

I have a passion for learning, and always find myself back in front of my laptop immersed in the latest tech and trying to make it work.

I am currently studying towards a number of Microsoft Azure certifications but my primary goals for 2022 are to complete  [#100DaysOfCloud](https://www.100daysofcloud.com/) and the [#CloudResumeChallenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/).
