### Hi there, I'm Vaz ðŸ‘‹

I have a passion for learning and solving problems, and I'm keen to share my knowledge with others. My early career was in systems engineering but since 2020 I have been running a 3d print farm and continuously working on automating it as much as possible.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 3d printing, raspberry pi conguration or home automation
